            <li>Examining content-related features of annual reports can be applied to fraud detection</li>

            <li>You can identify early and advanced stages of fraud using certain simple surface, or deeper linguistic features

                <ul>
                    <li>Percentage of sentences in active vs. passive voice </li>
                    <li>Readability index </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation of sentence length </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <li>Perhaps fraudulent managers tend to write more often in passive voice, in order to dissociate themselves from the ongoing situation</li>

        <h2>Fraud detection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cosine similarity metric can be used to define ‘abnormal disclosure’ as the deviation between the MD&A word distribution vector and the average word usage vector of non-fraudulent industry peers</li>

            <li>You can track the evolution of similarity  of a company’s year-to-year annual reports


                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>

        <li>A ‘Fraud Similarity Score’ can uncover fraud cases by calculating the cosine similarity between a firm’s abnormal disclosure and the average abnormal disclosure vector of firms previously involved in SEC AAER enforcement actions
